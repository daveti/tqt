tqt

TPM Quote Tools

There are 3 useful commands included in the tqt, which are used to
create the AIK (using privacyca.com), get the public key of that AIK 
and do AIK quote (including PCR value digest verification and signature 
verification).

NOTE:

1. Special thanks to privacyca.com to provide the original sample code

2. Needs libcurl, libcrypto and libtspi support

3. Quote verification is locally here, for the complete remote attestion, 
please refer to arpsec project
